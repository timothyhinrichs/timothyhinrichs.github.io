# About


For well over a year, there has been growing interest in **policy technology** in the field of **cloud computing**.  While everyone means something different by *policy*, for our purposes *policy* means anything that describes how the cloud should behave.  Policy might dictate the ideal behavior for the cloud in terms of compute, networking, storage, and applications, or it might describe the cloud's ideal behavior in terms of cost, risk, and security.  The abstractions and form of the description are irrelevant; what matters for us is that a *policy* describes how the cloud should behave.

The promise of policy technology is incredibly **attractive for customers** (organizations deploying cloud technology): people tell a cloud management system how the cloud ought to behave, and the computer system makes it happen automatically.  Policy technology helps people cope with the staggering size and complexity of the infrastructure that makes up a cloud, the applications that run on that infrastructure, and peoples' disparate ideas about how the cloud should behave.

Policy technology is **attractive for vendors** because once a piece of technology has been given a description of what is supposed to happen, that technology knows precisely *what* its goals are and is free to implement those goals *how*ever it likes.  This separation of what and how gives vendors the freedom to implement the same API as competitors yet be innovative and differentiate their products.  And by supporting policy, vendors give customers the ability to manage technology the way their customers would like to manage it.

The goal of this blog is to facilitate in-depth discussions about policy technology and how it can impact the world.  We plan to include tutorials, system descriptions, deployment advice, applications, algorithms, position pieces, and the like.  We will focus primarily on cloud computing, but we hope to include exciting advances in related areas as well.
