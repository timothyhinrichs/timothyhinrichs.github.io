# What is RuleYourCloud?

RuleYourCloud is a blog dedicated to cloud computing and policy languages, two  disparate technologies that we believe will inevitably become intertwined.  Today we see a growing number of cloud management products that support policy languages, a trend that will eventually enable a purely policy-based approach to cloud management.  Once we can use policy languages to control the cloud in its entirety, we will be ruling the cloud via rules (another term for 'policy').  Hence the name.
